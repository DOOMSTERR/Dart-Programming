 While coding we sometimes don't want to change the value of a particular key word in such a case we use CONSTANT key word.

>>> final name = "Oslo" ]
>>> const PI = 3.14     ]        //value for name & PI will remain same throughout the program

Diff. between FINAL and CONST keyword.

# Final------ variable can only be set once and it is initilized when accessed.

     i.e. final name = "Oslo"
 
     no. of times name is called it will be initilized at that time only.

# Const------ variabvle is implecetly final but is a compile time constant.

     i.e. initialise and memory allocation during compilation.  

# Instance variable------var defined in a class(i.e. member variable), it is similar to class variable, it can be final but cannot be const.

if you want to create a constant at a class level then make it STATIC constant
